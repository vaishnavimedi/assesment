Last Sentence that contains most used word:
Basically, two types of auctions exist. In ascending-bid auctions the price for an object starts out low and is increased by degrees. In descending-bid auctions a high bid is first made, then the price is consecutively lowered until someone expresses a willingness to pay the object. Numerous variations of these two patterns can be found. For example, the "buyout option" used in eBay, Yahoo Auction, and other places lets customers who detest uncertainity procure an object for a high price. Auctions can also be held in open or closed formats. Open formats are transparent: everyone knows what is current price for an object is. Closed formats are opague: only the seller is able to tell how much each customer is willing to pay for an object. Closed formats provide greater privacy and written documentation, though open formats generally spawn higher bids.
